## Introduction to Sustainable Development Goals

The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030.

## AI Integration in Business Services

Artificial Intelligence is transforming business services through several key mechanisms:

1. **Automation of Routine Tasks**
   - Implementing AI-powered chatbots for customer service
   - Automating repetitive administrative processes
   - Using machine learning for data entry and processing

2. **Personalized Customer Experiences**
   - Analyzing customer behavior to predict preferences
   - Creating customized product recommendations
   - Delivering tailored marketing messages based on user profiles

## Self-Management Learning Techniques

Self-management learning emphasizes personal responsibility for learning outcomes through structured approaches.

## Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Criteria

ESG criteria are increasingly important standards for a company's operations that socially conscious investors use to screen potential investments.

This example demonstrates how the RAG system references existing materials when designing courses.
